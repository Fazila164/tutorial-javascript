Stone Paper Scissors Game Project: Crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this web game brings the classic challenge to life. Enjoy responsive design, user-friendly interface, and seamless gameplay on any device. Experience timeless fun in a modern digital playground.
Here's the explanation of how our project works:
	You have three icons representing rock, paper, and scissors on the webpage.
The computer also secretly chooses one of these options.
	You click on one of the icons to make your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
	Behind the scenes, the computer randomly picks one of the three options.
	Your choice and the computer's choice are compared based on classic Rock Paper Scissors rules.
The choices and the result (win, lose, or draw) are then displayed on the webpage.
	Icons may visually enlarge when you hover over them, providing a bit of interactive and visual feedback.
	There's a brief delay before displaying the result for a smooth visual transition.
	You can play the game again by clicking on another icon.
